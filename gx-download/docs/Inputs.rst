Inputs
======

GX is currently set up to be run from input files. The main input file has a user-supplied name,
such as ``a01`` or ``scan/a01``, to which the suffix **.in** should be appended. In these examples, 
the input file names are ``a01.in`` and ``scan/a01.in``. In the first case, the input file is in
the current directory. In the second case, the input file is in a directory called ``scan``,
which itself is located in the current directory.

Important: If you are using an input file in another directory, and if you are also referring to additional
files (perhaps for a restart, perhaps to specify geometric information, etc) then the file names
for the additional files must also include the longer path.


The input file
--------------
*There are two standards for the input file. One is deprecated and is not documented here.
If you are exploring src/parameters.cu and find yourself confused by the logic there, you are
almost certainly looking at obscure coding that supports the old standard. That obscure coding
is itself deprecated.*

The main GX input file is parsed with `toml <https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11>`_.

The toml standard allows one to group related input variables. There are multiple
ways to specify such groupings. Since there are sample input files provided
with GX, here we will pick one particular syntactical pattern. Users are free
to use anything that is compatible with the `toml <https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11>`_ standard.

There are two input variables that are not part of any group:
