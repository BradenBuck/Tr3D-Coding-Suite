# Tr3D-Coding-Suite
Repository with copies of QSC, geometry code, and GX (July 15, 2021)

This repository will allow us in the geometry and critical gradient groups to view the relevant codes in one repository and to have flexibility in modifying the codes and exploring them.

Note: The geometry code is within the folder for gx and is labeled "geometry_module".
